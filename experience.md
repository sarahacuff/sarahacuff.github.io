# Experience

The majority of my clinical assignments were spent at Moses-Cone with additional time spent at Alamance Regional Hospital. My Community Health clinical experience was spent in a congregational nursing setting at Freedom’s Hope (a day center for unhoused and housing insecure residents) and the Salvation Army, both in Burlington, NC. And my final capstone introduced me to high acuity surgical patients and was completed under a preceptorship at UNC’s Cardiothoracic Critical Care Unit.
