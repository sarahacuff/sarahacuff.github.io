# About

![Headshot left](media/headshot-rect.webp)

I am a recent graduate of Elon University’s Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing, with a background in outdoor education and austere environment medical response. My journey back to school after an initial undergraduate degree in Global Studies has included my own health events including Lyme disease and a reinvestment in my education. My pursuit of nursing is motivated by a desire to coalesce all the skills I’ve learned through outdoor guiding and teaching wilderness first responders in service to bedside care for people confronted with significant challenges to their health.
