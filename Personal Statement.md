# Personal Statement

First and foremost, I view good medical care as a social science, one that is practiced collaboratively and as a team between clinicians, a patient, and their support community. The values that guide me in pursuit of good medical care are teamwork, humility, curiosity, compassion that drives competency, equity-promotion, flexibility, and balance.
