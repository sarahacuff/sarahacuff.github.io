# Professional Plan

My initial goals for my career include finding a new graduate position in some form of critical care to continue the learning I’ve begun with my work through NOLS Wilderness Medicine and my preceptorship on a cardiothoracic critical care unit. I intend to complete a hospital-based nurse residency to best prepare me for the transition to bedside care, and I plan to pursue CCRN certification once eligible.

I will continue to teach wilderness first aid and wilderness first responder courses as time allows because I believe promoting high-quality first responder training is a worthwhile public health intervention.

Eventually, I’d like to serve in some form of emergency preparedness role on a hospital committee or contribute to staff training for environmental disasters.

Looking ahead to addtional schooling, it's possible that I will pursue further education in the form of a Masters of Education specializing in Health Professions or a DNP program.
